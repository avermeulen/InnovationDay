*Visa Innovation Day - 22 August 2014

** Welcome

Welcome to the Visa Innovation day.

** Outcomes

By the end of this day you and your team would have built a Wireless Bluetooth enabled Nodebot. Along the way you might learn to solder, getting to know Javascript better, meet Git and learn how to pull and push code to github. Not to mention brushing of your electronic skills, using a breadboard again and even configure a Ultrasonic module. 

You will use:

	* Node JS
	* npm - the Node Package Manager
	* git
	* github.com
	* Fritzing	

** Backgound

We will be building a Nodebot that is a robot powered by Javascript, we will be using Node JS to program an Arduino micro-controller. The Node module we will be using is called johnny-five, this needs the Firmata sketch to be installed on the Arduino

** Setup

** Getting to know Johnny

** VisaBot build

** Motor Driver

** Bluetooth support

** A seeing bot

** Challanges
