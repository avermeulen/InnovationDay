#Ultrasonic support

By using an ultrasonic sensor we give the Visabot a sense of sight. Comibining it with a small servo we can cover a larger with the sensor.

Build the Ultrasonic model attached to the Mini Servo by following these instructions:

Once the ultrasonic module is built attach it to the front of your Visabot. Attach the wires as required.
